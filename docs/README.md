## Sensor Manager Documentation

#### What is the Sensor Manager library?

The ES2 (from “Emotion Sense Sensor Manager”) Library is a library project for Android application developers and researchers. The main goal of the project is to make accessing and polling for Android smartphone sensor data easy, highly configurable, and battery-friendly.

We take a very broad definition of the term “sensor:” we mean all of the different components of Android phones that can capture data about:

* The device’s physical behaviour. For example, its current location and movement.
* The phone’s social behaviour, such as calls and SMSs.
* The device status (e.g., screen state or battery level).

The goal of the ES2 Library is to provide quick and seamless access to the Android smartphone sensors, for both one-off and continuous data polling.

#### System Requirements
The ES2 library is available for all Android applications that are running version 2.3.3 and above.

Please note that this library has been built and tested using Android phones, and not the Android Emulator. We currently do not support development via the emulator.
